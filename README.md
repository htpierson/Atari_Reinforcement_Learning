# Galaxian Reinforcement Learning
This project is a reinforcement learning based AI that plays the Atari game Galaxian. Below we can see a video of the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) agent playing the game after being trained

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to explore the use of reinforcement learning to play classic Atari games such as Galaxian. We aim to create agents that can learn to play these games at a high level without being explicitly programmed to do so. Reinforcement learning has the potential to enable machines to learn from experience and make decisions in complex environments. By applying reinforcement learning to games, we can develop agents that are capable of learning to solve complex problems and provide insights into the effectiveness of different algorithms and approaches.

Through this project, we hope to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of different reinforcement learning algorithms such as A2C and DQN, and provide a framework for future research and development in this field. This project can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in learning about reinforcement learning, deep learning, or game development, and provides a practical example of how these concepts can be applied to real-world problems.
